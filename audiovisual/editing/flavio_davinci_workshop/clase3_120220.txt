!In the project manager the one with a red checkmark is the one that is open/active

Timelines
=========

- aka Sequence in other programs

Image scaling and changing scopes
---------------------------------

- If you shot in a different aspect ratio and want to resize by cropping the top and bottom into what you compose already from camera you can do so by going to Project Manager > Image Scaling > Input Scaling > Mistmatched resolution files > Scale full frame with crop. This will:
  1) Scale up the frame
  2) Crop it according to the other aspect ratio

- If the idea is to go from 16:9 to cinemascope you just add bars covering top and bottom. You do this by going to Timeline > Output Blanking > 2.39

In other words:
  - If your footage is in 16:9 and you set the timeline to HD/UHD but want it to look like cinemascope or anything else bc of creative reasons you have to add bars.
  - If your footage is in 16:9 and you set the timeline to something else and get black bars on the side then you need to image scale to fill those gaps.

Windows
-------
- Media Pool: the same as always
- Metadata: the same as always
- Effects Library: to add effects, transitions and titles
- Inspector: to transform a clip, stabilize it, lens correction, etc.

Main Hotkeys
============
J K L = play backward, stop, play forward. Hit J or L several times to get more play speed 2x,4x
I O = mark in/out
Shift + I O = Go to in/out
Shift + X = Clean both in and out
Up and down arrows = jump between clips in the timeline
Cmd +/- = Zoom in and out of the timeline
Q = change between Source and Timeline playbacks
P = Full screen

Timeline bins and naming
========================

Bin example:
Master
|_ CARDS
  |_ projectname_001
  |_ projectname_001
|_RUSHES
  |_ SCN001
  |_ SCN002
|_CUTS (or EDITS)
  |_ CUTS001 (or EDITS001) -- for each scene a new bin
    |_ SCN001-0 (SCN001v0 / SCN001 VERSION 0) -- first timeline version for this scene

Three point editing
===================

Point 1: In
Point 2: Out
Point 3: Where in the timeline it should be

Overwrite
---------
This is just dragging with the mouse or F10 after marking in/out. Usually to add something to the end but can also be used to literally overwrite a clip that is already in the timeline, whatever it comes over it will be "deleted" from the timeline.

Insert
------
This is just dragging with the mouse and then holding Cmd+Shift or F9 after marking in/out. You can do this between a cut or a clip. If it is between a clip it will just split it and move the second part to the right with the rest of the timeline.

!Overwrite/insert just video or audio can be done by either draggin from the source using the frame/waveform icons. Also can be done with the keyboard by activating/deactivating a certain video/audio track.

Patching
--------
Changing the destination of the source.
Video: Cmd+shift+up/down/number
Audio: Cmd+alt+up/down/number

Exercise
--------
- use the photographer shots
- 3 shots of the guy in the morning
- something from the interview that makes sense, a full idea. As the guy is answering place 3 working scenes (just video) on top.
- 4 shots of the wuy working and taking photos

Refining
========
For further versions you can go into several modes/tools

Selection Mode (A)rrow
----------------------
To delete or move

Trim Mode (T)rim
----------------
To change durations

Replace (F11)
-------------

Cut (B)lade
-----------


!Do not unlink audio and video, is better to unlink the *selection* (shift+cmd+L) and then do what you want with the audio/video separately without desyncing them. Alternatively use alt before clicking to just select one of the parts.
