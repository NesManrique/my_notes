Organizing the project
======================

What to do with the clips:
- Bins
- Naming clips
- Metadata
- Markers (e.g. an interview with a large clip, mark Q&As)
- Subclips

Naming
------
- By shot order, e.g. SCENE-SHOT-TAKE (2-3-1),(2-3-2),(2-3-3)
  ! Usually the last take is the best  
- By shot type + subject

Keywords
--------
Used to identifying things relevant in a clip.
Examples:
- "graffiti" in kotty shots examples
- "good" for takes you like
- "night" or "day"
- characters.
- noisy shots.

Clip Colors
-----------
Assign the same color to a set of clips

!Remember: If you add metadata to several clips at the same time you have to click SAVE at the end.
!Also recomended to add the roll card in the metadata.

Markers
-------
Used to identify moments of interest inside the shot.

Example:
- Mark questions and answers in a interview.

Mark (I)n/Mark (O)ut
--------------------
Define a range in a clip. The hotkeys are the same in every program.

We can turn a range into a "Duration Marker" where you can add a description, name, etc.

!According to flavio he doesn't use this too much he just cares about where something nice "starts" and do the rest of the decisions in the timeline.

!Enabling the zoomed audio waveform in the playback helps a lot on setting markers before dialog

Subclips
--------
Allows you to extract a smaller subclip from bigger clips.

Searching
---------
Click on the magnifying glass, generally better to search on all metadata.

Smart Bins
----------
Bins are created automatically based on search criteria

Transcoding and optimised media (proxied)
=========================================
In high end productions with lots of footage you _always_ transcode. The reason is because is convenient to share, playback and handle smaller files.

Process (aka Offline conforming)
--------------------------------
- Go to project settings > Master Settings > Optimized Media and Render Cache and set:
  * Quality:
    + Optimized media resolution (resolution): original, half, quarter, etc.
    + Optimized media format (codecs, sorted from better to worst): 
      = DNxHR HQX (for big productions, cross platform)
      = DNxHR LB (Low band, cross platform)
  * Destination folder (new media will be generated here)

!Proxies should be stored in your fastest disk. Probably where you have the media already. For connection protocols at the moment the fastest is Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbps) but USB-C is usually ok (10Gbps). For disk speed SSD and NVMe

To go back to the original media go to "Playback > Use Optimized Media If Available"

Post producer coordinator or Supervisor: The guy that designs and coordinates the whole post-production pipeline.

There is a proxy mode but it's only to work with color and it's not really worth it, better to ignore it.

Clip Attributes
===============

Changing frame rates
--------------------
Right click > Clip attributes > Video > Video frame rate

!Take a note of the original frame rate because it doesnt show it later.

Audio channels
--------------
Right click > Clip attributes > Audio

!If you want to change the way the channels are configured for a clip you have to do it _before_ adding them to the timeline because then you can do it for several clips at the same time.

By default if you have stereo audio it is shown as one track with 2 channels in it. The idea to separate them is mainly if you have several mics while shooting and want to change the audio separately for each of them.

Syncing video and audio
=======================

- Based on Timecode: Using a separate device as a single clock source and match the camera and sound recorder to that clock source.
  * Only takes the external audio and matches with timecode.
  * Append tracks: preserves the camera audio and adds the external audio as extra channels

- Based on Waveform:
  * Analyses the camera audio and the external audio and matches with the waveform.
  * Append tracks: preserves the camera audio and adds the external audio as extra channels

!Again when using append tracks by default it adds an extra stereo track with 2 channels mixed in it, so you would have 2 stereo channels. You have to go to the clip attributes to select how you want to organize the tracks.
